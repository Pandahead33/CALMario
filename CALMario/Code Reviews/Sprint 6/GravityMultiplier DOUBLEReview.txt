Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
GravityMultiplier is a cohesive and concise class that clearly displays what it does with the gravity of the game. 
Clearly it replicates different types of planets gravity in the game based on the game. 
Nothing is too verbose. 

Specific comments on code quality:
It is nearly a perfect class. It is possible to take out some of the floats as constants in a separate game file like
in the different Utility clases. Some of the code may seem a bit redundant 


A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current 
implementation could or could not easily support that change:
Perhaps a GravityUtility class would be overkill but it could also encapsulate the Gravity and
then presumably this class would never have to be modified and Gravity types could be kept separately.
