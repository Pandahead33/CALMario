Specific comments on code quality:
This class has naturally high cohesion and low coupling due to its simplicity.
I do think that the class could be simplified in the parameters that it takes.
I think it's possible to just take the initialLocation Vector2 as a parameter,
and remove the rest of the parameters as the rest are not needed for this class.
As for passing the additional parameters to StoreBlockState, again I think that
just passing 'this' while removing all other parameters would be a good decision
to reduce what the class has access to since Game1 is very powerful.  The other
parameters could be taken care of with commands in the StoreBlockState class which
would, again, limit what the class has access to.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current 
implementation could or could not easily support that change:
A hypothetical change that could be made to the game that is easily supported
would be virtually any change outside of the class as the class relies very little
on outside code.
