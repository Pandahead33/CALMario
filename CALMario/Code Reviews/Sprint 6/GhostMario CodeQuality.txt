Specific comments on code quality:
Update makes reference to GhostInputs class's static members. Hinders ability to expand to have multiple ghosts, rather than storing the inputs locally.
Use of NullStateMachine -- no powerup behavior but will not error. Importantly, it outsources powerup handling code to outside the class, reducing dependencies.
Use of GameUtility constants in the constructor is good practice and makes it more adaptable to a change in the GameOverScreen time.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current 
implementation could or could not easily support that change:
Support for multiple ghosts. The only thing really hindering this is the reference to the static GhostInputs.
If there was a way to store the inputs locally, one could just create a lot of GhostMario instances, each encapsulating their own behavior.
As it is, however, there is no way to keep track of distinct lines of input.
