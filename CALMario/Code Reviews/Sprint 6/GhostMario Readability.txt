Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
Provides minimal getter/setter implementation for IMario's properties. 
Typechecks in CollideWithBlock make it a bit unclear what's able to collide and what isn't. This is exacerbated by the nested conditional.
Other than that is well formats and easy to read and scroll through (there's not much else to it).
