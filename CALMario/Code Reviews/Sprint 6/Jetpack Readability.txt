Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
This class is quite readable due to the fact that it mostly utilizes the ItemKernel class.
Furthermore, the collision response method (CollectedBy) is very easy to understand since it is using the IMarioPowerupStateMachine
interface to provide the functionality for what happens after gaining the jetpack item.
