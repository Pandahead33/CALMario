Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
As a factory, it is fine on code length. It is also pretty readable. However, it seems to encapsulate some commands in it and other commands in other places. Some of the naming conventions could be confusing. For instance, In addition, CommandFactory seems to have only X and Y commands- but what about jump? Where is that handled? I guess it is just a little bit confusing  as to how the old commands correlate to the new commands. Overall, it is a good start and a well made Factory.
