Sprint #: 4

Name of the .cs file being reviewed: Mario.cs

Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Melinda Studans

Specific comments on code quality: Structure of class is clear and relatively well-organized.
Like-methods are grouped together, such as collision methods, and coupling is low when possible
and reasonable.  Overall, code is clean and well-written.

A hypothetical change to make to the game: Any changes to the level design, items, enemies or
anything mario collides with would leave this class virtually unchanged.
