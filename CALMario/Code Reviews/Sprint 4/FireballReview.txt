Specific comments on code quality:
The class makes good use of fields that store the fireball's dimensions and speed. 
I like that the class extends a ProjectileKernel class, which means that the Fireball
class only needs to provide enough information that makes the class different from other projectiles. 
Thus, the only information that needs to be set is the fireball's sprite, location, and physics data.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
Perhaps, we wanted to add a different type of projectile to the game (ex. darts), and we wanted darts and fireballs to have some similar collision
handlers but also some different collision handlers. This class would easily be able to support that change. We would just need to put all of the
shared code in the ProjectileKernel class. Then, we would override any of the collision handler methods that are specific to just fireballs. In 
the darts class, we would similarly override any of the collision handler methods that are specific to just darts.
