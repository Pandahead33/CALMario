Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
Names do not follow convention (properties not PascalCase)
A few of the steps in creating the transform matrix seem unnecessary, such as multiplying by a rotation of 0.
It's not clear why base.Update is commented out.
A few magic numbers in update.
