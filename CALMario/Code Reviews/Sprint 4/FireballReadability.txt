Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
Overall, the class is extremely readable, particularly because it extends the ProjectileKernel class. Thus, it
inherits all of the methods and properties from ProjectileKernel, so it only needs to provide the information
that makes the fireball different from other types of possible future projectiles. The code is simple and concise. 

There is nothing in particular about the class that is unreadable. Perhaps, the two fields could have been
renamed to be more descriptive so that the comments would not be needed.
