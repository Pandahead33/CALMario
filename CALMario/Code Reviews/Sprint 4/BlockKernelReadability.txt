Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
I don't think there is anything particular about this code
that is not easily readable.  The only thing that really
takes a second to understand is the if statement in the
CollideWithMario method, but even that is pretty straightforward.
The names make it obvious what you're working with and each
line of code is clear and concise.
