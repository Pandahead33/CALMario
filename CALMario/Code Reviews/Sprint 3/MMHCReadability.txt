Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
Are all those imports used? 
 
This is an expansion off of the earlier command sequence and creates movement. Some of the variables names are a little unclear. I assume pixels refers to how much it is moved by. Perhaps a name such as “moveBy” or velocity may be more descriptive for later use. 
 
Is changing the location directly the best way? Does both player and game have to both be used?  I suppose the current way the code is set up but there may be a way to encapsulate it further. 
 
Nevertheless, it is very readable and obviously works.
