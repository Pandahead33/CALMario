Name of the .cs file being reviewed: CollisionDetector.cs

Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Melinda Studans

Specific comments on code quality: Structure of class is clear and well-organized. If you
have knowledge of the project, understanding this code is fairly straightforward.

A hypothetical change to make to the game: Any changes to the layout of the level, adding enemies,
adding items, changing the size of enemies or items, or any changes to desired collision response
would require minor modifications, if any, to the code.  The code is written well as to avoid dependencies
on other classes that might need to be changed.
