Sprint number: 3

Name of the .cs file being reviewed: TestCommand.cs

Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Cole Coulter

Specific comments on code quality: Structure of tests is clear. Resets and Asserts seem repeated a lot; possibly could abstract that to one process on a test.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
Changing the level. Since the coords are hardcoded this isn't an easily supportable change. Perhaps instead create a new initialization for the game world, and spawn in your own goombas/mario/etc?
