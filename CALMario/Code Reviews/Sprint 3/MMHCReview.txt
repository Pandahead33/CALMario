Specific comments on code quality: I originally reviewed MoveMarioHorizontally, but since it was deemed to be unnecessary to change I decided to review CodeFactory instead. Clear structure, incredibly readable. It encapsulates a lot of data that was previously just hanging around. It also does this in a way that is modular and cohesive. Additionally, the coupling is as good as it could possibly get.  
 
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
Perhaps a dictionary could streamline this further but seems unnecessary. This class is, for all practical purposes, perfection.
