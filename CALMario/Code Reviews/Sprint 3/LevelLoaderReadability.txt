Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
Method names and variables are generally descriptive enough to understand. It is nice to be able to understand
what methods are doing without needing to read the entire method. One exception is 'convertCharacterToBlock';
the name of this method implies that only blocks are created. However, this is not the case. I would suggest either
renaming this method, or segment this method (which is quite long) into logical divisions based on what is being created.

Usage of whitespace is perhaps a bit excessive, which requires one to scroll large amounts to view the file. 
(This may be an issue related to line endings not matching, but I'm not sure)
