Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
From an outside perspective, ICollidable is pretty readable
though somewhat ambiguous to those unfamiliar with its function.
To those familiar with its function, however, it is clear and
concise, easy to read and manipulate, and the methods have clear
descriptive names well-indicative of their functions.
