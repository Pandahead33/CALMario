Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
Each test is well isolated. As of this review, actual development of the tests must still be done, but the structure is clear; 
tests are carried out with the game being reset between tests.
It's constructed like most commands, taking a single Game1 parameter. The use of the ICommand interface makes its use clear.
