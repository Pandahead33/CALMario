Specific comments on code quality: 
While the switch statement inside the convertCharacterToBlock method is readable, it takes up a large amount of space, and 
it makes the method quite long - about 50 lines. A dictionary would be a more concise method for handling this.
There are a decent amount of 'magic numbers' in the file.
File has good, simple structure and a clear, single purpose. 

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
Adding more sprites or objects to the game would be fairly easy to handle, since it would just be a matter of adding more switch cases (or dictionary entries).
