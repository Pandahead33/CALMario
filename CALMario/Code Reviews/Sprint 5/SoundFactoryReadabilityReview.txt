Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
The SoundFactory class has very easy to understand and succint methods since
each different sound effect has its own method to create it and a corresponding
SoundEffect property. The class follows the conventions in other classes by loading
all of the content in a method that is called by the Game class. There is nothing
about this class that is particularly unreadable.
