Specific comments on code quality:
The purpose of this class is to reduce the amount of code
and functionality present in the main Game1 class.  As such
the function contained in this class serve very different 
purposes but all relate to game functionality in some way.
These methods are clear, concise, and independent of each 
other.  Only variables that need to be public are public
with the remaining variables being accessible only within
the class.

A hypothetical change that this class could easily support 
would be nearly any additional functionality relevant to 
the Game1 class.  Because this class is so close to the Game1
class, much of the functionality of Game1 is easily accessed 
and manipulated from this class.  For example, a rewind function
could be added to LevelManager with virtually no extra access 
or permission needed.
