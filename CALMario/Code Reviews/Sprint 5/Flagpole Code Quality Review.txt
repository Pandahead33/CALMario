Specific comments on code quality:
Implements an interface, so is flexible; no additional definitions over what is required by the interface. 
As such, there's very little that could go wrong.
Uses the command pattern for its collision reaction, a gain reducing dependencies/knowledge/coupling.
To further reduce coupling, Draw delegates to Sprite's underlying implementation.
Physics is privately set, so there's more information hiding there.
