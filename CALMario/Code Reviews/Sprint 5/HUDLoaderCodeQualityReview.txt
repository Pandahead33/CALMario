Specific comments on code quality:
Though the HUDLoader is one of the more verbose classes,
the functionality it contains is necessary. Whenever HUD or
other on-screen graphical elements are involved- it takes a lot of code.
In addition, the code is even bigger due to the fact there are not easy
to replicate parts for HUDs in Monogame.

Some of the code is simplified with additional methods for increased
cohesion. I'm not one hundred percent positive all of the private fields 
are needed since some are constants in the DisplayLoaderFilesUtility.
I assume this was made beforehand. Other than that, great class!
