Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
As with most GUI related things, a front facing HUD is inherently verbose because it has to access high level components that are not able to be controlled by the implementer.
However, this does make it very readable and the variable names complement the higher level functionality. It is clear what everything does and is very modular. This
cohesion is what allows it to be extra readable instead of just a single giant draw method. Excellent choice!
