Screenshots have been included in the "VSO Screenshots" folder of our planning dashboard for sprint 4.

Instructions:
WASD/Arrow Keys to move Mario.
z to jump
x to throw fireballs (when in fire state)

These controls are based around the original NES controls, with 
wasd/arrow keys mapped to the d-pad, and
z to a, and x to b.

q to quit.
r to reset the game.
p to pause.

Additional Features for Sprint 6:
1. Ghost Mario: After a user has made at least one attempt at the game, a "Ghost Mario" will appear that shows Mario's movement from the last run of the game. Ghost Mario's movements reset once the player has died, won the game, or run out of lives.
2. Jetpacks. A jetpack is available from the top block in the series of ? blocks at the start of 1-1. If Super, Mario can collect it to become Jetpack Mario. Hold Up or W to get a thrust of 3/8 pixels/frame/frame upwards. 
3. Change Mario Gravity: Change the way gravity affects Mario by toggling Default gravity, Moon gravity, and Mars gravity by pressing 'G' in game.
4. Press b to go to the shop. The price for the block is above it. It is 5 coins for a normal item block, 10 coins for a one-up and 15 coins for a jetpack. This is meant as a "cheat code"/easter egg for players who find it.
