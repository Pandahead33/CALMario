Overall, the breakdown chart for sprint 6 shows that the team was not meeting the ideal trend for a majority of the time.
There are a variety of reasons for this. Firstly, the team was more pressed for time than the other sprints since this
sprint was only a week long. Furthermore, the group had more obligations than usual this week than in previous sprints.
However, all team members were still able to complete all assigned tasks. The group could have improved the work trend 
by better budgeting time during the week and accomplishing small segments of work each day.
